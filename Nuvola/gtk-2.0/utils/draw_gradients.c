/* Most of the following functions were taken originaly from the 
 * IceGradient & EnGradient engines, however, after taking a 
 * look at the sources more closely I realized that 600+ lines
 * were a waste of repetetive code in multiple routines, so I merged
 * the bulk of the code into one major routine: gdk_draw_gradient,
 * which was then broken out into alloc_gradient_color to take care of
 * several repetitions of that. I then took style specific code from
 * EnGradient and converted into style_draw_gradient, which simply
 * called to gdk_draw_gradient for the real work.
 *
 *It still needs more work, and better support for multiple gradients.

 * Explanation of the quadratic gradient formula:

 *  |\        /        If you use linear gradients in buttons the text is difficult to read because

 *  |  \    /          shorter in the center where the text will be. An easy way to do it would be
 *  !   -__-           to set the relative distances between steps corresponding to a something like
 * -+----------|-x                            y = (x - w/2)Â² for x in [0,w]
 *  |          w       where w is the number of steps in the gradient.
 *                     At step w you'll have the acumulated sum of all steps and thus
 *                                   int(y, 0, w) = wÂ³/12
 * At each step you would get
 *                               int(y) = xÂ³/3 - wxÂ²/2 + wÂ²x/4
 * If you want a coefficient in [0,1]
 *                      int(y) / int(y, 0, w) = 4xÂ³/wÂ³ - 6xÂ²/wÂ² + 3x/w =
