This is 6nome a theme for the Metacity window manager and a
matching theme for GTK+ 2.x and GTK 1.x

The Metacity theme...

  ...is based on the GNOME logo. It has embossed title text and features
  the GNOME footprint as the menu button.

The GTK themes...

  ...have rounded corners, thin borders and light and few colors. They
  are loosely based on the background of the GNOME logo. They are
  designed to look as similar as possible.

Themed stock icons.


INSTALLATION
------------

Just unpack into your ~/.themes directory and use gconf-editor to switch
theme.  My version of metacity reads themes from ~/.themes but
metacity-setup looks for them in ~/.metacity/themes; you can solve
this moving the content of your ~/.metacity/themes to ~/.themes. Then
delete the .metacity/themes folder and make an alias to the .themes one.
(just type, from terminal: ln -s ~/.themes/ ~/.metacity/themes)
