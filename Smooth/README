This is the Smooth GTK engine, currently it supports GTK2 and GTK1.2, however GTK 1.2 support is a bit messier/less reliable then GTK2, although it has improved a bit in recent CVS, most noticable problems are changing themes causes sliders and scrollbar sizes to misbehave unless gtk1.2 apps are restarted afterword.

The GTK 1.2 version adds nice support for reading most GTK2 Style Properties and xthickness & ythickness, however it is incomplete and only actualy sets a few of them.

to make,  run: 
  ./configure --prefix=<prefix> [--enable-gtk-1] [--enable-gtk-2=no]
  make
  make install

FEEL FREE TO HELP!

The current version is full of messy & sometimes downright screwy code. I am still attempting to clean up and somewhat organize most of the code, however in the process I often mess up the actual functionality of code, I am slowly finding and fixing these things, but feel free to organize and/or fix the stupid things I have managed to destroy and have yet too fix.

Also, feel free to improve in anyway that makes sense. Though I would prefer proper functionality before adding of new features.

To sum up : if you have the inclination to do so, I would not be opposed to patches to fix any portion of the code whatsoever, from figuring out what to do with draw_polygon to make it obey the theme line style, to fixing any retarded thing I might have done while adding GTK1.2 support, or any of the other more recent features and fixes.

Enjoy!
